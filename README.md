# NutriGrow
Introductory Project
In the realm of child healthcare and nutrition, our project has taken a significant step forward by developing a basic yet effective tool for malnutrition detection and diet plan recommendations. The primary objective of this project was to create a user-friendly application that aids in identifying a child's nutritional status based on input height and weight, and subsequently provides actionable diet plans tailored to different age groups. Through meticulous implementation and careful consideration of the underlying algorithms, we have achieved a meaningful solution to address a critical health concern.
Our project successfully integrates data handling, analysis, and user interface design to create a cohesive application. The Graphical User Interface (GUI), developed using the Swing framework, allows for easy interaction, making it accessible to healthcare providers, parents, and caregivers alike. By leveraging Apache POI libraries, we have enabled the application to efficiently extract data from Excel spreadsheets, making the process of malnutrition detection streamlined and accurate.
The core strength of our project lies in its accuracy and relevancy. By implementing tolerance thresholds for matching and incorporating distinct diet plans for various age groups, we ensure that the recommendations are well-suited to the child's developmental stage. The diet plans provide a balanced and practical approach to addressing malnutrition concerns, with a focus on locally available foods and nutritional needs specific to each age category.
While our project has successfully achieved its primary objectives, there remain opportunities for expansion and enhancement. The foundation we have built can serve as a springboard for future developments, such as incorporating a more extensive nutritional database, interactive educational content, and the exploration of a mobile app version to extend the reach of the tool.
